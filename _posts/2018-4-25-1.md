My first memory of discovering porn was on a dial up modem at my family home (I didn't erase the history, leading to my first coming out). At 13 I had already discovered what my sexuality was so I knew exactly what I was looking for, however this foray lead me to discovering erotica.

Turns out I was far more interested in reading about Harry Potter fan-fiction with Draco and Harry hooking up then I was looking at images of muscle dudes. My formative teen years were spent printing off long stories written mainly by females about broomsticks, magic and fucking in classrooms; then reading them at night once my parents had gone to bed. This lead to me missing out on a few of the realistic aspects of gay male sex (cleaning out, being detached from romance etc) which didn't adequately prepare me for later life.
