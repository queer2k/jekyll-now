A weird room in my best friendâ€™s house I only went in that one time despite having spent so much time there. It smelt weird and was all pink and seemed to house exclusively a bed and his dads collection of beaver mags (did his dad have a jack-off room?). My friend was excited to show me but I was not interested at all. I pretended. His mum came home after and sent me home with a wagon-wheel.
