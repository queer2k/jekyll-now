My first memories of searching out porn on purpose all revolve around one very basic website – short video previews in a list on a red background. I imagine I found it by searching ‘gay porn’ or ‘boys kissing’ or something. I kept coming back for one preview of two very pale skater twinks exchanging blowjobs.

One had shaggy bleach blonde hair and a surfer necklace, the other wore a beanie pulled all the way down to his eyebrows and over his ears. I would sneak peeks at the website whenever people were out of the computer room. Eventually I waited until everyone was out (maybe I faked a sickie from school?) and spent the day print-screening my favourite pause-frames, cutting them out into word documents, blowing them up, and printing them out on the family ink-jet printer. I had maybe three pages of this that I folded up and hid in Gus, my giant gorilla teddybear.
