My first experience of porn is when my dad bought this box of VHS tapes from a carboot sale and a few of them were pornographic. These were hidden in a bag under a bed. Whenever I got annoyed or angry I'd go and look at it to rebel....but it also kinda calmed me down. ðŸ˜‚ I didn't find online porn until much later on when my friend showed me.

And I can't really remember when it switched to including gay porn. But I think I got really into car sex and then I stumbled on a baitbus vid where a guy would suck off a blindfolded guy instead of the girl and then there would a reveal and he'd be paid to fuck him. And then I started seeing more and more queer porn.
