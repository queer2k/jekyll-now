One of my initial experiences with gay porn was in my late teens. I googled "gay porn", and soon found a solo vid of a guy whacking it who looked almost exactly like my neighbour who I fancied at the time. Because my access to porn was restricted to the late hours (one family computer in the study and that's it in terms of internet access) I decided to print screen numerous stills of the video, and then printed them out.

I kept them in the DVD case for the movie Gray Gardens, as I was sure nobody would wanna watch it besides myself. Years later I'd find this same print out (still undiscovered) when I visited home. It was funny looking back in retrospect, because this felt so outrageous at the time.
