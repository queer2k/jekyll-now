I remember that as a child I always watched movies in the hope of seeing female nudity. Often the ﬁlm itself remained a side issue as I was only waiting for a woman’s breasts to be shown.

At night we could see a pay channel with bad image and white noise (the signal probably got to our TV from the neighbors’). Often when my mother and sister had gone to bed I’d watch that pay channel and wish that, by some miracle, I’d begin to see it properly. I didn’t believe in God those days but once I even prayed that the channel would show.
