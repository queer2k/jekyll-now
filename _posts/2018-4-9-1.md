I’ve spent lots of time in the so-called ﬁlm circles and we’ve also discussed porn. We’ve shown porn at the lesbian and gay ﬁlm festival, I’ve watched 70s porn at the ﬁlm archive, a few years ago the Swedish short ﬁlm collection Dirty Diaries evoked broader discussion. But often these discussions aren’t all that much about the content of porn.

They tend to involve a certain distancing: it’s possible to talk about the fucking one has just seen in a cinematic or representational sense but almost never in terms of, well, who feels like fucking after watching that. It’s sort of a shame.
