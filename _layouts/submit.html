    <div>Are you queer and watch porn? Are you not but watch queer porn? Have you ever had a queer
        experience with porn? We would like to hear from you about your personal (or not so personal)
        memories and experiences of porn. We’d like to hear about how you’ve searched for, viewed,
        experienced, collected, stored, organised, hidden, shared… and got off to, porn, how porn has
        shaped you – your desires, perceptions, and sexuality – and anything else you can think of. Please
        write as much as you like, from a single memory or observation, to your entire porn history. Every
        reply is important.</div>
