Porn is a tricky thing for me as I'm on the asexual spectrum somewhere. I'm not attracted to people in porn at all but I do enjoy sexual experiences.

I guess I view porn in a very detached way. I focus on what the participants must be experiencing on a sensory level, and what I'm experiencing. It's a very introverted activity. Attraction doesn't come into it at all. Sometimes I feel like I'm acting, pretending to be someone who experiences sexual attraction.
