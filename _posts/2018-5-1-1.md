My first experience with porn was when I was about 11 or so, typing in “porn” or “boobs” or something trivial into google and looking at whatever came up. It was so fascinating back then haha. A few years down the line, I found “the process” took longer watching straight porn and it wasn’t as exciting as it was before. Then, I found gay porn and have been watching it on/off ever since.

Early on, I’d convince myself that I was “straight but really liked gay porn” somehow (which...didn’t last). I came out as bi after a really intense crush on a girl but still kept watching gay porn I guess.
